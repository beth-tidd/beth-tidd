ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @beth-tidd

I'm an Information Technology student with my concentration in software and web development at Southern New Hampshire University. I'm not quite 100% sure what I'd like to do with my degree yet, as I am still new to the world of software development, however, I have been enjoying learning the basics of web development lately!

I am based in North Carolina, where I live with my partner, our two cats, and my crested gecko. I enjoy video games and streaming on Twitch in my free time, where I mostly play Animal Crossing.
